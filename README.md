O(n^2)

Bubble Sort goes through the list item by item, and switching the current pair if they are out of order.

- This process is repeated as many times as necessary to order the list

the function we create wants to

1. move through list.

	* if it finds a faulty order, reorder that, and stop traveling through the list

1. print the current list

	* if there were changes: repeat

	* if there were no changes: end function.
